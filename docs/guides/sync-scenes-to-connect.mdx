Once your data has been [imported](./import-data.mdx), we can leverage the metadata properties of [scenes](./render-static-scenes.mdx) to synchronize data
to the Vertex Connect application.

## Configuring a scene to be synchronized

The Vertex Connect application leverages [webhook events](./webhooks.mdx) to detect when scenes have been created or updated within the same account.
By adding a set of metadata properties to these scenes, they can be automatically synchronized to a workspace and optionally a folder.

### CONNECT_WORKSPACE_URN

The `CONNECT_WORKSPACE_URN` metadata property represents the URN of the workspace and folder that the scene should be
synchronized to. This can be found under the `Settings` dialog within the workspace.

![Workspace URN](/img/connect/workspace-settings-urn.png 'Workspace URN')

### PLM_PART_ID

The `PLM_PART_ID` metadata property optionally provides a way to indicate whether synchronized scenes represent a revision of a
part or assembly. If scenes are created or updated with a `PLM_PART_ID` that is identical to another scene's `PLM_PART_ID` in the same workspace,
that scene will be synchronized as a revision of the existing scene rather than a separate item.

:::caution

If you plan to use the `PLM_PART_ID` field for revisioning, make sure that the initial scene is created or updated with the `PLM_PART_ID`
before or with the same request that sets the `CONNECT_WORKSPACE_URN`.

## Setting the scene metadata

After you have found the `CONNECT_WORKSPACE_URN` associated with the workspace where you want your scene to appear, and optionally determined
a `PLM_PART_ID` to use for creating revisions of the scene, these metadata properties can then be added as part of either the creation of a
scene or as an update to an existing scene. Below are examples of both requests.
