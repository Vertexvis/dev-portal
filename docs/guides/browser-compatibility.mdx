description: Browser compatibility for the Vertex platform's Web UI Components.
---

Our web components should work with most modern browsers, including those that support the [Custom Elements v1 specification](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/web-components/customelements). For many browsers without Custom Elements v1 support, we automatically use polyfills. We support both mouse and touch interactions out of the box.

\*Indicates the current version of the browser

The web components may work in older browsers but require additional polyfills. We cannot guarantee support for browsers outside of our compatibility matrix.
