description: Use Vertex Platform's collaboration APIs to communicate with team members.

This guide explains the core concepts and API usage for enabling collaboration
within your application using the Vertex Collaboration APIs. These APIs allow
your users to participate in structured discussions through contexts, threads,
and replies.

:::note
This guide assumes that you have already configured authentication for
your deployment. Some APIs require a user access token obtained via [token
exchange](../guides/authentication#token-exchange-rfc8693).

## Core Concepts

### Collaboration Context

A **Collaboration Context** is a container for discussions related to a specific
resource — such as a 3D model, a project, or a design session. Each context
defines who can participate via one or more associated **User Groups**.

### Thread

A **Thread** represents a focused discussion within a collaboration context.
Each thread has two important properties that help categorize and manage
discussions:

- **Type:** A thread can be either an `issue` or a `comment`. An `issue` thread
  is typically used to flag problems, bugs, or actionable items that may require
  resolution. A `comment` thread is intended for general discussion, feedback,
  or non-blocking remarks.

- **Status:** Threads have a status that indicates their current state. An
  `open` thread signifies an active discussion or unresolved issue, while a
  `resolved` thread indicates that the topic has been addressed or closed.

### Reply

A **Reply** is an individual message within a thread. Users can reply to threads
to continue discussions, provide updates, or give feedback.

## Access Control

- Only users in the user groups associated with a context can interact with its
  threads and replies.
- Threads and replies **require a user access token** obtained through an
  RFC8693-compliant [token exchange process](../guides/authentication#token-exchange-rfc8693).
- Collaboration contexts are managed using **application-level access tokens**.

## API Usage

:::note
If calling these APIs from a browser, your deployment will need the
`CorsOrigin` CloudFormation parameter for your deployment.

### Collaboration Contexts

| Operation                          | Endpoint                                        | Auth      |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | --------- |
| Create a context                   | `POST /collaboration-contexts`                  | App token |
| Associate user groups to a context | `POST /collaboration-contexts/{id}/user-groups` | App token |
| List all contexts                  | `GET /collaboration-contexts`                   | App token |
| Get a context by ID                | `GET /collaboration-contexts/{id}`              | App token |

### Threads

| Operation               | Endpoint                                           | Auth       |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| Create a thread         | `POST /threads`                                    | User token |
| List threads by context | `GET /threads?filter[collaborationContextId]={id}` | User token |
| Get thread by ID        | `GET /threads/{id}`                                | User token |

### Replies

| Operation              | Endpoint                             | Auth       |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ---------- |
| Post a reply           | `POST /replies`                      | User token |
| List replies in thread | `GET /replies?filter[threadId]={id}` | User token |
| Get reply by ID        | `GET /replies/{id}`                  | User token |
