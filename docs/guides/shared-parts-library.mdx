Shared parts library

# Motivation
To facilitate organization and access control of parts shared across an enterprise, the Vertex API provides the
concept of shared parts libraries. The granularity of control is at the level of Vertex platform accounts.
A parts library (as created and accessible through `/parts` and related API endpoints) from one account can be shared
with another with read-only access, allowing users in the granted account to make scenes with shared parts, separating
management of the shared library from its usage.

# Description
## Grants
*Grants* are made from a grantor account to a grantee account. Creating a grant requires credentials for the grantor
and a UUID identifier for the grantee. There are two domains of grants, `parts` and `property-sets`.

## Scope of parts domain
Once a `parts` domain grant is made, users of the grantee account will be able to make scene items using parts from the
grantor account (without credentials for the grantor account), but will not be able to add, remove, or otherwise
modify the parts in the grantor's library. Regardless of the source of the parts, the created scene items will still
be owned by the account from which the creation calls were made.

## Scope of property-sets domain
Once a `property-sets` domain grant is made, users of the grantee account will be able to see metadata properties for the
parts from the grantor account (without credentials for the grantor account), but will
not be able to add, remove, or otherwise modify the metadata properties in the grantor's library.

A `property-sets` domain grant is typically only useful along with a `parts` domain grant between the same accounts.

## Scenes vs. parts
Once shared parts and metadata properties are incorporated into a scene through `/scene-items` and related API
endpoints, they will be visible to users of the grantee account. When grants are revoked, these scene items will still
be visible in these scenes. Grants only control the scene creation, and all further viewing or manipulation of the scene
is governed by the account in which the scenes and scene items are created.

# Usage
## Account IDs
Accounts are identified by UUIDs assigned when they are created. The admin dashboard can be used to find these
UUIDs if they were not recorded when the accounts were created.

## Making and revoking grants
Grants are made with the `POST /permission-grants` call.

Grants are revoked with the `DELETE /permission-grants/:id` call.

## Getting and listing current grants
Grants are listed with the `GET /permission-grants` call. Individual grants can be retrieved by ID with
`GET /permission-grants/:id`

## Listing available parts
Once a `parts` domain grant is made, the `GET /parts` call will default to listing all parts available to the
calling account. The parts returned from this include an `owner` property in the `relationships` property, so that the
owning account can be distinguished. The `GET /parts` call can be filtered by a specific owner by including an `ownerId`
filter.

## Creating scene items with granted parts
Once the grant is made, creating a scene item with a granted part is identical regardless of which library the part
comes from.

## Metadata
Metadata from the parts library will only be included on scene items if the `property-sets` domain grant is made along
with the `parts` domain grant.
