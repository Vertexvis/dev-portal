The following diagram gives an overview of how your applications interact with the Vertex Cloud.

![Vertex Platform Architecture](/img/vertex-platform-architecture@4x.png 'Vertex Platform Architecture')

In the [Render your first scene](./render-your-first-scene.mdx) guide, we focus on the **Your Application** section, communicating with the Vertex WebSocket using Vertex's test stream key. In the [Import data](./import-data.mdx) guide, instead of having you create an API in the **Your Cloud** section, we use the Vertex CLI, which uses the Vertex API Client to communicate with the Vertex REST API using OAuth tokens.

In the [Build your first application](./build-your-first-app.mdx) guide, we create a deployable application with an API. With this application, you can securely talk to both the Vertex WebSocket and Vertex REST API. Using these pieces, the full power of the Vertex platform is in your hands.
