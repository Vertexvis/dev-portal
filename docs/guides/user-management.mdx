description: Use the User Management APIs to manage users and groups within the Vertex Platform.
---

The Vertex Platform supports managing **Users** and **User Groups**, which are
key components for controlling access and participation in collaboration
workflows.

This guide explains:

- What users and user groups represent
- How external identity providers relate to users in the system
- The APIs available to create and manage them

## Core Concepts

### Users

A **User** represents an individual who can participate in collaboration. Each
user must be uniquely identified and tied to an external identity provider (IdP)
when integrating with external authentication systems.

- To associate a user with an external IdP, you must set the `idpId` field.
- The `idpId` **must match** the user identifier returned by your IdP during
  token exchange (e.g., the `sub` field from the `/userinfo` response).
- Some endpoints (such as `/threads` and `/replies`) require a user token.

### User Groups

A **User Group** is a collection of users.

- Groups can have one or more users.
- Groups can be given an external identifier using the `suppliedId` field.
- A user can belong to multiple groups.

## Relationship to Identity Providers

When integrating with an external identity provider, such as Okta, Azure AD, or
Auth0:

- Users authenticate through your IdP.
- Your application exchanges their IdP token using the [Token Exchange flow
  (RFC8693)](./authentication#token-exchange-rfc8693) to obtain a Vertex
  Platform user token.
- The Platform uses the `OidcUserinfoEndpoint` Cloudformation param to retrieve
  user claims (such as `sub`) and matches the `sub` to the `idpId` field on a
  user in the Vertex Platform.

If the `idpId` does not match an existing user, token exchange will fail.

To support this:

- Ensure users are provisioned in the Vertex Platform **before** performing
  token exchange.
- Always use the same identifier as returned by the IdP (case-sensitive).

## API Overview

See our [API reference](https://docs.vertex3d.com) for more details and examples
of the User Management APIs.

### User

| Operation        | Endpoint                      | Auth      |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------- | --------- |
| Create a user    | `POST /users`                 | App token |
| List users       | `GET /users`                  | App token |
| Get a user       | `GET /users/{id}`             | App token |
| List user groups | `GET /users/{id}/user-groups` | App token |

### User Groups

| Operation         | Endpoint                        | Auth      |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------- | --------- |
| Create a group    | `POST /user-groups`             | App token |
| Get a group       | `GET /user-groups/{id}`         | App token |
| Add user to group | `POST /users-groups/{id}/users` | App token |

## Best Practices

- Provision users at the time of account or workspace creation, before
  collaboration begins.
- Use consistent and stable `idpId` values (e.g., UUIDs from the IdP).
- Use groups to manage access at a logical level (e.g., "Reviewers",
  "Engineers", "External Vendors").
