## A

<DescriptionList
  items={[
    {
      term: 'access token',
      definition: (
        <>
          A secure type of authentication that is used to make API requests on a
          user's behalf. Vertex uses{' '}
          <a href="https://oauth.net/2/">OAuth 2.0</a> Bearer tokens to
          authorize a specific application to access specific pieces of a user's
          data. Each token is valid for one hour.
        </>
      ),
    },
    {
      term: 'assembly',
      definition: (
        <>
          A structured collection of subassembly and part geometry. An assembly
          is considered a part in the Parts Library. However, it's a part with a
          hierarchy and children.
        </>
      ),
    },
  ]}

## C

<DescriptionList
  items={[
    {
      term: 'camera',
      definition: (
        <>
          Represents the position, direction, and perspective in which you view
          your scene. Simple mouse and touchscreen actions let you rotate, pan,
          and zoom the camera's viewpoint in the Viewer component. You can also
          set camera parameters using API calls.
        </>
      ),

        </>
      ),
    },

## G

<DescriptionList
  items={[
    {
      term: 'geometry set',
      definition: (
        <>
          The lowest-level geometric primitives (the simplest of geometric
          shapes). In most cases, use the parts APIs instead.
        </>
      ),

## M

<DescriptionList
  items={[
    {
      term: 'material',
      definition: (
        <>
          A representative substance that is applied to 3D models to create a

      ),
    },
  ]}

## P

<DescriptionList
  items={[
    {
      term: 'part',
      definition: (
        <>
          A reference to geometry imported into the Parts Library. It may also
          contain metadata, PMI, etc. An assembly is also a part, but with a
          hierarchy and children.
        </>
      ),
    },
    {
      term: 'part revision',
      definition: (
        <>
          A specific version of a part. Your Parts Library may contain multiple
          revisions of a single part.
        </>
      ),
    },
    {
      term: 'Parts Library',
      definition: (
        <>
          A repository where you import your organization's parts. You can build
          scenes using any combination of these parts.
        </>
      ),
    },
    {
      term: 'platform account',
      definition: (
        <>

## R

<DescriptionList
  items={[
    {
      term: 'rendering session',
      definition: (
        <>
          The viewing or rendering of at least one frame in a browser or mobile
          application. Each rendering session lasts 30 minutes and is considered
          one unit. You can render as many frames as you like during each
          session before being charged for additional sessions.
        </>
      ),
    },
  ]}

## S

<DescriptionList
  items={[
    {
      term: 'scene',
      definition: (
        <>
          What you see displayed in a viewer. Scenes contain a collection of
          scene items (references to parts or geometry sets).
        </>
      ),
    },
    {
      term: 'scene alteration',
      definition: (
        <>
          A collection of operations performed on scene items in scene views.
          For example, updating the material on multiple scene items at once or
          resetting transforms.
        </>
      ),
    },
    {
      term: 'scene item',
      definition: (
        <>
          The viewable objects in a scene. Scene items reference either parts in
          the Parts Library or geometry sets. A scene item includes transforms
          that describe its orientation within the scene, and optional color
          material and visibility overrides. When you add a scene item that
          references a part with hierarchy, scene items get added for the parent
          part and all children.
        </>
      ),
    },
    {
      term: 'scene view',
      definition: (
        <>
          Used to isolate scene modifications such as camera and scene item
          updates. This lets users view and modify a scene without their changes
          impacting others who are viewing the same scene. When you load a scene
          using the Viewer component, your scene view is created, and is
          typically viewed in a browser or mobile application.
        </>
      ),
    },
    {
      term: 'scene view state',
      definition: (
        <>
          A saved scene view. When you create a scene view state, you're
          capturing the scene view as it appears in the viewer–the camera
          position, visibility, transforms, materials, etc. This makes it easy
          to return to saved states.
        </>
      ),
    },
    {
      term: 'session',
      definition: (
        <>

            <i>rendering session</i>
          </a>
          .
        </>
      ),
    },
    {
      term: 'stream key',
      definition: (
        <>
          A secure type of authentication used to grant the Viewer component
          access to view a specific scene for a specified time.
        </>
      ),
    },
  ]}

## T

<DescriptionList
  items={[
    {
      term: 'transform',
      definition: (
        <>
          The term used to describe translating, scaling, and rotating a scene
          item.
        </>
      ),
    },
  ]}
/>

## V

<DescriptionList
  items={[
    {
      term: 'Web UI Components',
      definition: (
        <>
          UI components developers can use to build browser based 3D
          applications. They contains{' '}
          <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components">
            Web Components
          </a>{' '}
          you can embed into simple JavaScript applications or more complex web
          applications built with React, Vue or Angular.
        </>
      ),

      term: 'visibility',
      definition: (
